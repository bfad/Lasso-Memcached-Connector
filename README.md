Lasso Memcached Connector
=========================

A Lasso type that allows Lasso to interface with memcached.

To Do
-----

Create unit testing.

Create instructions on how to use it

Enable it in it's own thread so it can act as a global (Or just post that in the instructions)

License
-------

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. If you examine the code, you'll notice that a helper function is adapted from the Lasso 9 source code. Lassosoft has not published the license they have released that source code under yet, but if it is incompatible with the Apache 2.0 license, then that function's code will be licensed under the same license that Lassosoft eventually chooses instead of the Apache 2.0 license.
